<h1>Secure-password :</h1>

<h3>I had written a tool Who would take a series of information from the user and create a list password for us</h3>
Now this time I wrote a program Which can give you a very strong and non-hackable password :)
<h1>Before seeing the output of the tool, I must say a few things : </h1>
You can use the following command to see the help list => py main.py --help

    usage: main.py [-h] [-u] [-l] [-d] [-p] length

    Password creator

    positional arguments:
      length       Length of password

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help   show this help message and exit
      -u, --upper  User Upper case
      -l, --lower  User lower case
      -d, --digit  User digit case
      -p, --pun    User punc case



<h1>To enter the password you have to give the program a length and enter -u -p -u by entering the command => py main.py 20 -u -p -u </h1>
<h1>Output :</h1>
